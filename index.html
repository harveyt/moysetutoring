    <h3>English and Social Studies</h3>
  </header>
  <p>
    Moyse Tutoring works alongside high school and college students
    that need assistance with English, Social Studies or
    Humanaties. It aims to provide a nurturing and caring place
    where young adults and teenagers receive custom-fit tuition. It is
    a location where tutoring is skilled, knowledgeable and professional,
    and where students have the opportunity to flourish.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many students require extra help with their courses at one time or
    another: it may be that they are struggling with a particular
    aspect of the subject, or have a demanding assignment to complete or
    exam to write. They might be preparing for further education, or
    need help composing an essay or paper. Some need just a couple of
    sessions, some may require several more. Moyse Tutoring works with
    each student to find the best resources and the most appropriate
    teaching and learning approaches to help them achieve their
    objectives, whilst keeping parents/guardians appraised of
    progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tuition takes place online, typically via video conference
    (eg. Skype, FaceTime or WeChat) and online document sharing
    (eg. Google Docs). It is available from 11am to 8pm weekdays and
    Saturdays.  Sessions can be one-on-one, or for a group of up to
    four. Tutoring is also available as needed during the school
    holidays, and at other times by arrangement. There are no formal
    contracts or obligations: tuition works best when there is a
    foundation of trust built between student, tutor and parents.

    <h4>Tutor</h4>
  </header>
  <p>
    Su is originally from London, United Kingdom. After gaining her
    Bachelor’s degree at the University of Sheffield, Su worked for
    several years in sales and marketing. Feeling that she wanted a
    more fulfilling career, she re-trained as a secondary school
    teacher at the Institute of Education (University of London). Su
    then went on to teach at three public schools, before emigrating
    to Canada with her husband in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
    For two years, Su worked at a private secondary school in
    Vancouver, teaching Geography 12, Planning 10 and Social Studies
    11. She then decided to pursue post-graduate studies, and gained
    her Master’s degree (Curriculum and Pedagogy), from the University
    of British Columbia in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
    Su then worked as a tutor in English and Social Studies
    for a small independent academy, where she gained a reputation
    as a much sought-after and innovative educator. In 2015, she
    decided to set up her own tutoring service, and Moyse Tutoring was
    created in December of that year. Su is covered by professional
    insurance and has police checks from both Canada and UK.
  </p>
  <p>
    Su has a very clear perspective on how tutoring should be
    directed, and firmly believes that there is a need for
    exceptional, high quality tuition that is designed for the
    individual student. In her spare time she loves to write short
    stories, and these can be found in
    her <a href="/post/">Writing</a> section.
