      “…human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you cannot
      predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a farmer, is create the
      conditions under which they will begin to flourish.”

    Moyse Tutoring has been set up to work alongside students who are having difficulties with
    English or Social studies at high school or university. Its aim is to provide a nurturing
    environment where young adults and teenagers receive custom-fit tuition: a place where
    they will begin to flourish. It is a given that the tutoring provided is skilled,
    knowledgeable and professional.
  </p>	  
  <p>
    High school and university/college students often require extra help with their courses:
    it may be that they struggle with a particular subject, or have a demanding project to
    complete; or that they are preparing for further education, or need help composing an
    essay. Some need just a couple of sessions, some require many more. It is the aim of Moyse
    Tutoring to work alongside the student to find the best teaching and learning methods and
    the most appropriate resources to help the student achieve their objectives, and at the
    same time, keep parents/guardians appraised of progress.
  </p>	  
  <p>
    All tutoring takes place in a custom-designed tutoring room - a location that that allows
    students to feel comfortable and at home, but that allows them to focus on the task in
    hand, and make the very most of the time given. All materials and resources are of the
    best quality, and wholesome snacks and warm drinks/water are available (especially for
    those students who have just finished their school day).
  </p>	  
  <p>
    Tuition takes place from 3.30pm to 8.30pm on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, and
    from 11am to 6pm on Saturdays. Sessions can be one-on-one or for a group of up to
    four. Tutoring will also be available as needed during the school holidays, and at other
    times by arrangement. Students are assessed initially by a free 20-30 minute
    consultation. In this way parents and students can get to know Moyse Tutoring, and ideas
    discussed so that sessions can be prepared ahead of time. There are no formal contracts or
    obligations: tuition works best when there is a foundation of trust built between tutor,
    parents and students.

  <p>
    Su is originally from London, United Kingdom. After gaining her bachelor’s degree at the
    University of Sheffield, Su worked for several years in sales and marketing. Feeling that
    she wanted a career that would create more of a legacy, she re-trained as a secondary
    school teacher at the Institute of Education (University of London). Su then went on to
    teach at three public schools, before emigrating to Canada with her husband in 2004.
  </p>	  
  <p>
    For two years, Su worked at a private high school in Vancouver, teaching Geography 12,
    Planning 10 and Social Studies 11. She then decided to pursue post-graduate studies, and
    gained her Master’s degree (Curriculum and Pedagogy), from the University of British
    Columbia in 2013.
  </p>	  
  <p>
    Since then, Su has worked as a part-time tutor in English and Social Studies for a small
    independent academy, where she has gained a reputation as a much sought-after and popular
    tutor.  Su has a very clear perspective on how tutoring should be directed, and firmly
    believes that there is a need for exceptional, high quality tuition that is purpose-built
    for the individual student.
