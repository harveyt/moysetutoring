    <h2>Moyse Tutoring</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Moyse Tutoring works alongside students who find themselves having difficulty with English
    or Social Studies. It aims to provide a nurturing environment where young adults and
    teenagers receive custom-fit tuition: it is a place where they have the opportunity to
    flourish, and where the tuition provided is skilled, knowledgeable and professional.
  </p>
  <p>
    High school and university/college students often require extra help with their courses: it
    may be that they struggle with a particular aspect of the subject, or have a demanding
    project to complete or exam to write. They might be preparing for further education, or
    need help composing an essay or paper. Some need just a couple of sessions, some may
    require many more. Moyse Tutoring works with the student to find the best teaching and
    learning methods and the most appropriate resources to help the student achieve their
    objectives, whilst keep parents/guardians appraised of progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    All tutoring takes place in a designed-for-purpose tutoring room: a location that that
    allows students to feel comfortable and at home, but that allows them to focus on the task
    in hand, and make the very most of the time given. All materials and resources are of the
    best quality, and wholesome snacks and warm drinks/water are always available (especially
    for those students who have just finished their school day).
  </p>
  <p>
    Tuition takes place from 3.30pm to 8.30pm on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, and
    from 11am to 6pm on Saturdays. Sessions can be one-on-one, or for a group of up to
    four. Tutoring is also available as needed during the school holidays, and at other times
    by arrangement. Students are assessed initially by a free 20-30 minute consultation. In
    this way, parents and students can get to know Moyse Tutoring and sessions can be prepared
    ahead of time. There are no formal contracts or obligations: tuition works best when there
    is a foundation of trust built between students, tutor and parents.

  </header>
  <p>
    Su is originally from London, United Kingdom. After gaining her Bachelor’s degree at the
    University of Sheffield, Su worked for several years in sales and marketing. Feeling that
    she wanted a more fulfilling career, she re-trained as a secondary school teacher at the
    Institute of Education (University of London). Su then went on to teach at three public
    schools, before emigrating to Canada with her husband in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
    For two years, Su worked at a private high school in Vancouver, teaching Geography 12,
    Planning 10 and Social Studies 11. She then decided to pursue post-graduate studies, and
    gained her Master’s degree (Curriculum and Pedagogy), from the University of British
    Columbia in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, Su has worked as a part-time tutor in English and Social Studies for a small
    independent academy, where she has gained a reputation as a much sought-after and
    innovative tutor.  Su has a very clear perspective on how tutoring should be directed, and
    firmly believes that there is a need for exceptional, high quality tuition that is
    purpose-built for the individual student.

      “Human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you cannot
      predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a farmer, is create the
      conditions under which they will begin to flourish.”
