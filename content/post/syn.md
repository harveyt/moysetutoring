Vision is always synaesthetic.  
Impure, permeable, blurry.  
Other senses come creeping in,  
unwelcome and bad-tempered,  
not wiping their feet and demanding cups of tea. 

Ear-plugs don’t work.  
Sounds wiggle their way around the latex  
to remind you of what was said,  
what music was playing. 

A taste forms in your mouth.  
Is that coffee? Caramel perhaps.  
It’s on the tip of your tongue.  
Perhaps it isn’t a taste at all.  
The scent of something you can’t quite remember. 

Meanwhile, there is a scratching at the back of your neck.  
It’s not the label; you cut that out.  
It’s persistent and uncomfortable and rolling your shoulders doesn’t shift it.  
It’s a reminder: defining the object is tricky.
