Vision is always synaesthetic.  
Impure, permeable, blurry.  
Other senses come creeping in,  
unwelcome and bad-tempered,  
not wiping their feet and demanding cups of tea.

Ear-plugs don<span dir="rtl">'</span>t work.  
Sounds wiggle their way around the latex  
to remind you of what was said,  
what music was playing.

A taste forms in your mouth.  
Is that coffee? Caramel perhaps.  
It<span dir="rtl">'</span>s on the tip of your tongue.  
Perhaps it isn<span dir="rtl">'</span>t a taste at all.  
The scent of something you can<span dir="rtl">'</span>t quite remember.

Meanwhile, there is a scratching at the back of your neck.  
It<span dir="rtl">'</span>s not the label; you cut that out.  
It<span dir="rtl">'</span>s persistent and uncomfortable and rolling your shoulders doesn<span  
dir="rtl">'</span>t shift it.  
It<span dir="rtl">'</span>s a reminder: defining the object is tricky.
