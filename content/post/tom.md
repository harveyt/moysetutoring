Swoosh. The train glides along the tracks, as if, well… as if it is on rails. Tom finds the sound
hard to describe in his mind. “Swoosh” is not quite right; more like a quiet Tie Fighter, perhaps. A
Tie Fighter with laryngitis? He is bored. The mystery paperback he picked up at Euston is not at
all, “A gripping mystery perfect for fans of Agatha Christie” as it was advertised. A whodunnit,
where a) he has already guessed who dunnit, and b) does not care enough about any of the characters
to continue on. So he is left with watching the world speed by as he makes his way North. The train
is only partly full, and he’s happy not to share his four-seater cubicle with any other
travellers. He yawns. Another cup of tea would be welcome. As if by magic, the steward/car
attendant/server comes by with another thermos and asks, “More tea, sir?” “Don’t mind if I do,”
replies Tom, offering his china teacup for a refill. As he takes a sip of his freshly-brewed tea, a
long-banished memory drifts into his mind: a train journey from his childhood, that he hasn’t
thought about in years.

He must have been seven or eight, when his parents took him on a holiday to Scarborough. They had
caught the train from King’s Cross; back then it had looked grimy and down-at-heel, and they had to
push their way through to the platform to board a train that had also seen better days. Tom had been
placed on seat opposite his parents with a white formica table between them. The seats were fuzzy
and rigid, and he could not get himself comfortable. Dad had placed their suitcases on the rack
above them, and had settled down with the News of the World and a cigarette as soon as the train
left the station. He remembers that there had been a buffet carriage on the train, but they had not
visited it, as mum had brought a flask of tea and cheese and pickle sandwiches to keep them
going. Tom had drunk his tepid tea from a plastic cup, wishing he could have a coca-cola.

It wasn’t all bad, though: as a treat, mum had also brought a packet of Jaffa Cakes, which Tom had
gobbled up, biting off the chocolate first, followed by the orangey bit, and lastly the sponge. Tom
was soon bored. He’d read through his Beano comic twice and was now peering out of the window at the
world going by, accompanied by the clickety-clack of the Intercity train. His mum took out her
interminable knitting; she was making him a new school jumper as he had recently gone through a bit
of a growth spurt. His arms and legs seemed to belong to someone else: gangly and awkward, sport had
become a nightmare as he fought to coordinate his errant limbs.

Mum’s hands moved quickly and skilfully, and the ‘V’ neck of the grey jumper with its thin red
stripe was taking shape. Tom wished he had a book to read, but his mum had said that he wasn’t
allowed to bring his library books as he might lose them and then they would have to pay the
fines. When they finally arrived at York to catch the connection to Scarborough, Tom had felt weary
and restless, not at all in holiday mood, and had grumpily shouldered his school duffel bag and
trailed his parents across the bridge and onto the next platform.

Faded snapshots of that week pass through his mind: images from a photo album taken with an old
Kodak Brownie. Building sandcastles, walks along the promenade, ice creams from the kiosk by the
beach. His parents are long since dead, having passed away within months of each other, one of a
monstrous heart-attack, the other of heart-break. Tom is grateful to them, hopelessly wishing that
they could see how his life has turned out, that somewhere they are looking down on him with
affection and pride.

Tom is looking forward to spending some time with Joe: he remembers their time at the Post Office
with affection. They had both been quite content to be regular postmen --- “letter carriers”
nowadays --- but they had carried far more than letters. Tom took pride in getting to know the folk on
his rounds. He’s never been particularly chatty or outgoing, but he was good at his job and his
regulars appreciated his attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond. And there was
one particular woman on his rounds that he’d got to know so well that he’d married her. Tom smiles
to himself as he thinks of her.
 
He’d noticed Caroline as soon as she’d moved in with her elderly mother. Mrs. Ramsey had been poorly for a while,  going from hale and hearty to skin and bone within months. She had tried her damnedest to carry on, but in the end she was too frail to walk much further than the end of the street. It had upset Tom to see her diminish week by week. When Caroline moved in, Mrs. Ramsey rallied for a while, but finally succumbed. Tom wanted to let Caroline know that he was so sorry to hear of her mother’s death, but wasn’t quite sure what to do. He hummed and harred over what gesture or words might be appropriate. In the end, he popped a “With Sympathy” card in with the rest of the post and left it at that. Caroline had opened the door when he was next on his rounds to say “thank you” for his condolences, and they had chatted for a bit about losing parents. Over the next month or two they had exchanged smiles and waves, with the occasional longer conversation when Tom had delivered a parcel or registered letter.

Tom was no spring chicken by the time he met Caroline: he’d had a few girlfriends over the years,
but nothing had really stuck. He recalls how Joe set him up on a blind date years ago with his
wife’s cousin, but they spent a miserable evening struggling to make conversation. Caroline was
different. He wanted to get to know her better, but fretted over how he could ask her out without
making a fool of himself. In the end, he took courage in both hands, bought a modest bunch of
flowers and knocked on her door one Sunday afternoon.

Like many who marry later in life, Caroline and Tom had taken a while to adapt to their new
circumstances, to get to appreciate each other’s little ways. Tom was constantly closing doors that
Caroline left open, and Caroline was forever putting Tom’s discarded clothes in the laundry
basket. Over the years they became inseparable: Tom could not imagine his life without his best
friend, but, tragically that is just what he was forced to do. It was so cruel. The disease that had
taken her mother got its wretched claws into Tom’s precious Caroline. The cancer took her quickly,
but life then seemed to slow down to a crawl. Tom had plodded on: books were a comfort in the lonely
winter evenings, but this was not the retirement he and Caroline had looked forward to.

Tom is woken from his reverie by a tannoy announcement:“We are now approaching Penrith North
Lakes. When leaving us here, please make sure you have all your belongings with you.” Tom nods in
compliance. He takes his carry-on case from the rack and puts his messenger bag over his
shoulder. Taking a last mouthful of tea, he steps towards the sliding doors, and drops the offending
paperback into the bin.
