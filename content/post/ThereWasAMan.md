There was a man who was precise.  
He was ready with his tape measure  
to ensure things measured up.  
Too long, and he would be irritated.  
Too deep, and he would belittle.  
Too wide, and he would side-step.  

He saw the world in opposites:  
this good, this not;  
this acceptable, that falling short.  

He liked his breakfast a certain way: his tea an exact hue,  
his newspaper, a comforting echo of his own convictions.  
He liked his work a certain way: his train on time,  
his desk organised, his eight hours clocked.  

There was a man devoured by guilt, survivor's guilt,  
brother, and mother and wife.  
He liked the art of conflict:  
to grind down the weary opposition  
with self congratulatory aggression;  
attrition sapping his opponents of their will.  

There was a man who started well;  
he loved his country and adored his wife.  
But his children left him confused and baffled;  
Responding to his relentless standards  
with trepidation and despair,  
with hiding and avoidance.  

There was a man who was loved.
