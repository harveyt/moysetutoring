Tell me:  
Why do you give up?  
Why you resist?  
Why you set your jaw against the smallest change?  
Why you reduce those in your orbit to maddened tears?  

Is it so hard to choose,  
so difficult to think another way?  
To take one meagre strand of thought  
and sew it in a different stitch?  
To consider for a scanty moment  
that another course is possible?  

Is it fear that glues you with leaden feet  
stuck in the same rigid position?  
Where does the terror come from?  
Why is your mind stuck in a Tupperware container  
with the lid snapped shut?  
Does anything - anyone - get through?  

Or does your lacquered carapace have so many layers  
that when grace and peace and comfort  
drift into your puny sphere  
there are no cracks, no fissures  
that can admit  
such solace?
