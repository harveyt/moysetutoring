I will not --- not any longer --- concern myself with the prattle of fools  
I will not listen to their worthless drivel.  
I will not take part in their pointless squabble  
I will not insert myself into their no-end-in-sight bickering  

I will not stop trying when hope is blurred  
I will not stop believing in light at the end of the tunnel  
I will not believe your truth-less opinion  
I will not include your nonsense on my list of things to worry about  
I will not embrace your version of the truth  

I will not be scared of you  
I will not be made to feel small  
I will not sit down and shut up  

I will not agree you could have done better  
I will not give you the benefit of the doubt  
I will not side with your bigotry  
I will not tolerate your intolerance  

I will not accept everything is meaningless  
I will not accept your version of events  
I will not accept your half-baked explanations  

I will not give up.
