Big man, beaming toothless.  
<!--more-->Lurching lumpily onto the bus,  
Bags crunching and rattling  
With cans and bottles,  
Pleased with his meagre treasure  
Takes up the whole back seat,  
Chatting away to himself. 

Old man, withered and worn,  
Scrawny legs crossed on the bus  
Squirming uncomfortably  
Spluttering and coughing  
He has no handkerchief;  
Glutinous spit propelled  
With every heave of his lungs.

Young man, unsteady on his feet,  
Clambers doggedly onto the bus  
Cumbersome body wedged in.  
Chuckles shamelessly  
Hands pressing on his knees,  
Straining against the nervous tic  
That ripples through him. 

Fur coat and no knickers, this town.
