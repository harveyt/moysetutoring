Give me a gift without strings.  
Give - gift me - something requiring no obligation.  
Give me something of yourself that you want to keep;  
Give me - gift me - a thought you want to conceal.  

Give me, honestly, openness and easily-understood;  
Give me no masking, no hiding, no half-truths.  

Give me silence rather than careless chatter.  
Give me quiet rather than chattered hubris.  

Give - gift me - ears that will listen; a heart that is willing.  
Give me tenacity, give me perseverance;  
Give me a spark of humanity. A crumb of humility.  
Give - gift me - a rejection of stubbornness and pride.  

Give me trust.  
Give me the custody of your crusted vulnerability,  
And I'll scrape off the veneer, layer by baked-on layer  
Give me your casket of doubt and sneering incredulity ---  
Give me to it willingly and I'll drop it down a well.  

Give me artless wonder, simple playfulness;  
Give me no-holds-barred susceptivity ---  
Give me something to believe you for.  

(Give me a mirror.)
