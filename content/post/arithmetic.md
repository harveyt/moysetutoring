The girl in the worn-out plimsols is posing for a photograph. She stands stiffly, gracelessly,
trying to look serious and authentic. It is not working.

I am in my second year in Mrs. R---'s classroom and we are studying French. Our lessons are on
scratchy 45rpm records; we listen carefully to the strange sounds and words, following along in our
booklets. Mrs. R--- has a student teacher helping her this year. She is not like pretty Miss M---
, who we had a couple of years back. She is much older, more motherly, with big glasses and bouncy,
curly hair. She looks a bit like an owl with a perm, although she can't do the 200 degree swivel
thing with her head. Mrs. R--- sometimes lets Mrs. S--- take the lessons in the afternoon: she
encourages us with our French. We are learning the basics. So far, I can say "hello", "goodbye",
"thank you", tell you what my name is, where I live and how old I am. That seems about enough to be
going on with. Mrs. S--- has also been helping us make papier-mâché glove puppets. She pronounces
papier-mâché with a proper French accent. Our puppet heads are a confection of bits of newspaper,
part-blown-up balloons, and cardboard egg cartons, all stuck together with wallpaper paste. I'm
making a witch with a hooked nose and pointed chin. She is painted green (witches have green faces,
everyone knows that), and has a black dress with a jagged hem. I chat with my friend J--- as we
work on our masterpieces; J--- is making a clown, complete with white face and enormous red grin
that takes up half its head. Mrs. S--- encourages us to do little puppet shows in French, but they
are not very good:

CLOWN: Bonjour  
WITCH: Bonjour  
CLOWN: Comment vous appelez-vous?  
WITCH: Je m'appelle Witch  
CLOWN: Quel âge quel âge avez-vous?  
WITCH: J'ai quatre-vingt six ans  
CLOWN: Au revoir  
WITCH: Au revoir  

J--- is my best friend. She lives along my road, and has a colour television. She also has an
annoying younger brother, but we do our best to ignore him, especially when he interrupts our
favourite TV programme. *Follyfoot* is about a teenager, Dora, who lives on a farm and takes care of
the horses. I desperately want to be like her. She is pretty and clever and has lots of friends and
a boyfriend called Steve. J--- also has a spangly new bike, all chrome and streamers, which she
rides up and down our cul-de-sac. I've also recently acquired a bike, but it is second-hand and a
bit tatty. It is light blue, with a white seat and handlebar grips. It is also a little too big for
me, and I labour to ride smoothly, wobbling along the pavement. This lack of skill is put to the
test in our cycling proficiency exam: J--- passes with flying colours, and I fail, having flattened
several cones whilst trying to stop at the zebra crossing.

We have recently embarked on a new and trendy English reading programme: SRA. I have no idea what
that stands for, but I like the way it works. Instead of everyone doing the same English work, we
take a big card from the box. The cards are colour-coded depending on the trickiness of the writing.
I've just finished Aqua, which means I only have Silver and Gold to go, and then I'll be finished.
However, this week Mrs. R--- announces, out of the blue, that we will be having an important test.
We are assigned seats, carefully separated from each other, and are given serious-looking booklets
in which to write our answers. The first part is dictation: Mrs. R--- reads out a passage very
slowly, repeating each sentence, and we have to write it down. I come unstuck when she says, "During
this period..." I cannot for the life of me remember how to spell "during". Does it start with a j?
And "period" has me flummoxed; I go through different permutations in my mind, but none of them seem
right. Eventually, I opt for "jering this peerod". I know it's wrong, but I have to move on before
she starts the next bit. Then it's on to the arithmetic: *"A train leaves London at 11.30am and
arrives at Bristol at 1.30pm, after stopping at Reading which is 36 miles from London. It travelled
both parts of the journey at the same rate. Find the distance from London to Bristol."* I don't care
how fast the train goes, and don't know how I'm supposed to "find" the distance. Is it lost? Has it
been buried somewhere and no-one can remember where? It is all a bit silly. I have a go at these
ridiculous puzzles, but most of them may as well be written in Swahili. Or Swedish. Or Swiss. At the
end of the test we are asked some questions about ourselves, including our hobbies. I say that I
enjoy reading, which is a stretching the truth somewhat. I like picture books, but I only read
"proper books" if I have to. I find concentrating on page after page of words quite exhausting. I
think whoever is marking my paper will think that I am very clever, and I am quite pleased with
myself. At the end of the test, Mrs. R--- collects our papers and puts them in a big pile on her
desk, and we can go to lunch. As we file out, I glance at the pile. Teacher's Pet has given
"colouring" as one of her hobbies, which is clearly a mistake: the examiners will think she is
stupid.

One of our last projects with Mrs. R--- is on the Victorians. The mother of one of our classmates
has an astounding collection of antique clothing, including several pieces from the Victorian era.
Mrs. R--- selects some of us to model the clothes and get Mr. B---, the school photographer to
take some portraits. We all covet the splendid satin wedding dress, complete with fragile veil and
silk flower headdress, and we all hope that we will be chosen as the bride. In the final photo
I<span dir="rtl">'</span>m trying to look serious, but I come off as confused. Unsurprisingly, the
prettiest girl in the class is wearing the beautiful wedding dress. I, meanwhile, am wearing a long
coat with tails (Victorian) and trousers (Marks and Spencer's). I am the groom. Of course! Clearly
Mrs. R--- felt that none of the boys in our class would be sensible enough to take on this role.
I<span dir="rtl">'</span>m also wearing my black PE plimsoles. What the photo does not show is that
the rubber sole of my plimsole is hanging off... I hobble along trying my best to disguise the fact.
I<span dir="rtl">'</span>m not sure what is more unfortunate -- my misery over being dressed as a
boy or my embarrassment over my worn-out plimsoles.

The bride in the raw silk gown is posing for a photograph. She stands easily, trying to look joyful
and content. It seems to be working.
