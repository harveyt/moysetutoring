History and all that clan malarky.  
You can take it or leave it.  
I\'d rather leave it if you don\'t mind.

Too cumbersome to carry about,  
like having to manoeuvre a four-tier wedding cake  
whilst running for the bus in sky-high stilettos.  
Like wearing lip-gloss in a howling gale,  
it just gets irritating and awkward.

Having to remember this and ponder on that,  
and try to work out who\'s who and who\'s not.  
Who's kith and who is kin, and what our forebears bore.

Best to leave that kind of baggage neatly stored  
in a hat box on the top shelf of the cupboard,  
or under the bed, or in the basement  
where it can argue with itself and collect dust.

Meanwhile, I\'m kicking off those glittery Louboutins  
and hailing a taxi. Barefoot.
