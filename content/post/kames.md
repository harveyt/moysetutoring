The girl with the too-short hair cut makes her way down the dirt path. She is taking the short cut
beside the football pitch; it peters out at the edge of the sea loch.

I tread with care; my wooden Dr. Scholl’s sandals are not designed for this terrain and I am in
danger of slipping. No matter. I can take my time since “uncle” L--- is still getting the little
boat ready. There is a cool, salty breeze coming from the loch, but I’m warm in my Aran jumper. My
mum made it specially for me; it has two rows of bobbly knots down the front that I twiddle with. My
shorts are still too big for me: hand-me-downs from my older sister that I have not quite grown
into. I reach the bottom of the slope without too much difficulty and stop to inspect my leg. There
are two pinky-red cloth plasters: one just inside my knee, and one on the outside of my ankle. They
are itchy, as are the dozen or so scratches that run down my leg from knee to foot. Stuffing my
thumb in my mouth, I count them slowly. There are fourteen, including the smaller ones. I continue
on my way over the rocky beach towards the water, still happily sucking my thumb. No-one is
watching, so I will not get the usual telling-off. “Only babies suck their thumbs,” my mother
scolds. At the water’s edge I put my toes into the water, testing it out. Too cold for swimming, but
good for paddling.

Further along I reach the mouth of the stream that runs beside our uncle’s cottage. here I have
spent gleeful hours exploring the narrow braided channels and miniature waterfalls. I like the
cottage with its wobbly salt-scraped wooden floors and ancient hair-stuffed sofa bed. I like washing
in the soft cold water. I like rifling through “auntie” N---’s draws: among the hair grips and
packets of Rennies I have found real treasure: a bottle of magical fake tan and a Max Factor
lipstick. The cottage has an outside toilet with a corrugated iron roof: torches hang in the
entrance way ready for night-time trips to the loo. We have been staying here for a few days: mum,
dad and my older sister. I like my uncle. He’s funny and kind, and likes making up little songs as
he potters about. Today’s song is about finding the equipment for fishing: “Ting-a-ling a-ling
a-ling, I’ve lost the ball of string…”, he trills. Mum and dad are not coming on the fishing trip:
mum feels guilty about not paying for the cottage (she is always embarrassed by anything that seems
like charity), and so I will be weeding the garden as payment. Dad is whitewashing the outside loo;
perhaps he feels guilty, too.

I am interrupted by my sister who comes sashaying down to the beach. I wish I could sashay, too, but
my movements are awkward and lumpen. We share the sofa bed at night with its buttercup yellow sheets
and scratchy pale woollen blankets. The cottage backs on to a rookery; at summer dusk the birds make
it difficult to get to sleep with their constant cawing and screeching. Last year, we scared
ourselves half to death: we watched “The Birds” on the cottage’s old black-and-white television, and
then huddled under the bed covers, terrified of the noise outside. My sister wants to know when the
boat will be ready, but I don’t know. There is something wrong with the outboard motor and Uncle
L--- is trying to fix it. While we wait, I take an amble among the rocks looking for
shells. Meantime, my sister grumpily throws pebbles into the loch, as if they had done something to
irritate her. The boat is ready, and the we head towards our uncle who is calling to us; my sister
marches in front with me trailing behind. We clamber in, and sit opposite each other on the bow. Our
Uncle L--- is at the stern, steering us through the shadowy water. I watch my sister under my
fringe. I cannot quite trust her; the barbed-wire fence has taught me as much.

Driving to the cottage we had both needed to wee, but since we were nowhere near a public
convenience, Dad had to stop at the side of the road. A barbed-wire fence was between us and the
bushes that would give some privacy, but we were both so desperate after the cherry colas at lunch
time, we had little choice. My sister had gone first, and I had followed, gingerly climbing over the
fence. On the way back, my sister was faster and more nimble, and, worried that I would be told off
for making my parents wait, I rushed my descent and slipped. The rusty barbs caught my right
leg. Straight away, I knew there would be trouble. My parents had to take me to the nearest hospital
for treatment; the bleeding stopped on the way, but the wounds needed cleaning and I would require a
tetanus injection. I apologised all the way there. The motherly nurse had been soothing and
re-assuring, but I knew it was all my fault. The throbbing pain of the injection in my arm that
night had seemed a kind of penance: what I had deserved for my clumsiness.

L--- cuts the motor, and the boat bobs for a time on the quiet surface. He sets a fishing line, and
lets it out behind the boat. It barely makes a shimmer in the water as we move off, heading south
towards the wide open inlet. Far too quickly, the line is being twisted and there is quick movement
in the water. L--- shuts the engine, and carefully draws in the line. Three mackerel have been
caught, their zebra backs iridescent as they are lifted out of the water. I can’t watch as he
swiftly hits their heads against the bottom of the boat. Supper has been supplied, but I will refuse
to eat it. I am sorry for the fish as they look up at me, surprised by their fate. I look out
towards the inlet, miserable. I am alarmed to see the weather up ahead: storm clouds are moving
quickly towards us, black and forbidding. Almost immediately, it starts to rain and Uncle L--- turns
the boat around, his face grim and rigid. He says nothing as the storm bears down on the loch. The
rain is coming down in sheets and my sister and I exchange frightened glances, but do not speak,
willing the little boat to the shore. As we near the rocky beach, L--- jumps out and pulls the boat
up to safety. We scramble out onto the rocks and run as fast as our legs will carry us up the slope
to the cottage. We arrive back, our Aaran jumpers soaked through. Mum instructs us girls to strip
off our sodden clothes and we dry ourselves on scratchy blue towels. Dad and Uncle L--- chat together
in the living room, watching the rain blurring the view of the loch. The storm passes over.

The woman with the long curly hair makes her way down to the beach. Along the strand line,
purposeful and ponderous, she searches for sea glass.
