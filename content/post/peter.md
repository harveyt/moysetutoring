Peter puts the phone down. He is troubled and disquieted by the twenty-minute conversation he has
just had with this older brother, David. He pours himself a generous glass of Glenfiddich and sits
back down in his armchair.

As they have aged, the two brothers seem to have grown apart. He can’t remember when this germ of
greed in his brother turned into such ugly clutching and grasping. Where did it come from? He takes
a sip of his whisky and sighs again. They came from respectable lower-middle-class stock;
dependable, caring parents. As children they were poor as church mice, but not destitute. Life got
better. The linoleum was replaced by wall-to-wall carpet, and the coal fires by central
heating. Their mother’s make-do-and-mend philosophy meant that they had what they needed, although
not always what they wanted. They have both done reasonably well in their chosen careers, both now
“comfortably off” as their father would have described it. Sadly, it seems as if David has become
the epitome of “knowing the price of everything but the value of nothing.”

He had phoned --- yet again --- to complain a cousin’s ownership of their grandfather’s ceremonial
sword from his time in the Navy. Peter couldn’t care less, but this slight (as he sees it) gnaws
away at David, who claims that the antique is worth a fortune and that their cousin snatched it
without asking. He insists that it should have been given to him since he had also served in the
Navy. Peter has a good relationship with this cousin, and knows him to be a very decent man; as
such, he believes that the sword is in safe hands and will never be sold. David is adamant that he
is in the right, and refuses to be persuaded otherwise. Peter just listens, offering no judgement or
agreement, interjecting with the occasional “Mmmmm” or non-committal “Aha…”; he knows from
experience not to bother arguing with him. Might as well talk to the cat, he thinks. Peter drains
his glass, rinses it out and makes his weary way up to bed.

After a less-than peaceful night’s sleep, Peter is feeling wrung out. He knows the conversation with
his brother has unsettled him, and the day’s news is no comfort. He folds his newspaper and
sighs. How did politics become this polarised? What has happened to public discourse? Why is it so
hard these days for people to accept that another person’s world view might not be their own? Or
’twas ever thus? Peter gets up stiffly from his breakfast table and walks with his cereal bowl and
coffee mug to the sink. He looks out onto the handkerchief-sized garden at the daffodils just
starting to poke through the cold, late-winter earth. The sun is struggling to come out, but here
and there the cloud is thin enough to allow a few rays of feeble sunlight to warm the grateful
soil. He thinks about his wife, who planted the daffodil bulbs several years ago, and is glad that
she did. He sighs again as he drys off the breakfast things with a tea towel, and replaces them back
in the cupboard. Checking his watch, he takes his heavy winter coat and woollen scarf from the newel
post at the bottom of the stairs and heads out.

Peter sits on the near-empty train on its way into London; he’s caught the semi-fast, and so should
be at Charing Cross by 11am or so. He’s left his newspaper at home, and is quite content to watch
the world go by as he travels through the dreary inter-war suburbs to the city centre. In his mind
he revisits some of the reporting from the morning paper. At one time he would have agreed with the
oft-repeated phrase that, “it was better back then”, but on reflection he realises he was
mistaken. What he had been remembering was what it was like to be in his 20s: his whole life ahead
of him, few responsibilities to burden him, and fewer sorrows to weigh on his heart. So much time to
waste! He knows it wasn’t better “back then”, it was just different. And he knows that he must not
become embittered by what irks him about his life now, including his brother’s carping and
complaining. He casts his mind back to the awful days of power blackouts and three-day weeks, the
months of alarming inflation that made penny-pinching an art form in his family. He thinks about the
dreary, second-rate television with its casual racism and patronising commentary. He sighs.

Peter heads towards the underground station: since it is still chilly outside, he takes the Northern
Line to Tottenham Court Road, and walks the rest of the way to the British Museum. It is a building
with which he is familiar: when he worked in central London he would often spend a lunch hour, or
some time after the close of business, at a museum or art gallery just to clear his head and put his
concerns into perspective. Today, he decides to visit Ramasses II, the subject of Shelly’s famous
poem about the Egyptian pharaoh.

Ramasses (aka Ozymandias) towers above the rest of the exhibits, with a half-smile on his lips,
seemingly amused by the whole spectacle. He’s bruised and battered: a hole in the right of his chest
is a memento from an attempt to raise him from the sands long ago; his body is cracked and his crown
is broken. A group of school children --- perhaps eight or nine years-old --- are crowded around the
huge granite torso, each drawing their own version of the piece. They work with heads bowed and
pencils scratching, like a clutch of servant scribes writing down the edicts of the god-like
pharaoh. One lad, bored of his task, looks up and catches Peter’s eye. Peter nods slightly in
acknowledgement and carries on down the gallery.

Sitting in the Court Cafe, enjoying a hot cup of tea and a slice of lemon cake, Peter considers
Ramasses. He thinks that the Egyptians were wise not to shun death, but to embrace it as part and
parcel of life. He remembers Shelley’s famous lines: “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”,
but Peter is not despairing. Not in the least. A smile (not dissimilar to that of Ozymandias),
appears on his face. Of course. Ramasses, once so powerful, so sure that he was right, so enamoured
of his own achievements is nothing but a shrivelled mummy; his colossal statue is broken in two, and
displayed in a museum for school kids to ignore at will. This gives Peter a little hope and a lot
more perspective. Political leaders come and go, treasures rot and turn to dust, but the human
heart, with all its frailties and foibles, goes on. As Peter leaves, he passes the granite
Pharaoh. He gives him a quick salute, and heads towards home.
