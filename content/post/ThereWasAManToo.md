There was man who was, at first, busy  
and then often absent.  
He was waited for, waited on.  
Admired, bragged about.  
Full of stories, tall and taller.  

Many interests, few of the heart.  
Many calculations, most too difficult to note down  
Too hard to measure, too dull to engage with:  
A line or two on the back of an envelope.  

Such ideas, such plans, such goals  
A wonder to behold  
Such a need for constant achievement  
Something new and shiny to test - to prove  
that he was worth something.  
That he could understand any thing and every thing  

And by understanding, measuring its weight  
And if there was not monetary value  
There was no value, no worth.  
And if there was no worth,  
It was something to be scorned  
Something for men with little minds  
To point their broken fingers at.
