**A nonsense story for Andy.**

Lassie is dog-tired. But, being a dog (specifically a collie) that’s not unexpected. She’s worn out
from an afternoon of herding sheep. Specifically, black-faced sheep. She lopes along next to Mr and
Mrs McTavish and their son, Joe. No-one speaks, as no-one (including Lassie) has the energy to
converse, be it in words, growls or barks. Lassie’s tail is jammed between her legs, and her sable
coat is splashed with peaty rain. The sheep have been particularly awkward this
afternoon. Admittedly, they are not the cleverest creatures on God’s green earth, but today they
seem to have lost their collective marbles. Going in twenty-three different directions at once,
crashing into fence posts, wandering across the road… Lassie was at the end of her patience when
they finally closed the gate of the holding pen and all fifty-six sheep were in one place. Shearing
is long-overdue, and gathering these daft animals from the heft was a wearisome task; Lassie had to
revert to giving some of the more stubborn members of the flock a nip on the back leg to get them
moving. Stubborn as a mule? Nonsense. Sheep have stubbornness in bags full.

As they trudge along the final stretch towards home, Lassie is looking forward to a nap in front of
the fire before supper. The McTavish family have a splendid wood fire in the living room, and the
copper-coloured rug in front of it has always been Lassie’s domain, even when she was a small
pup. She imagines curling up and letting the crackle and hiss of the fire provide a soothing doggy
lullaby. As they finally enter the house, Lassie is first through the door, and before Joe and his
parents have kicked off their boots and struggled out of their rain jackets, Lassie is fast
asleep. She snores softly, dreaming wolf dreams. Occasionally, her feet twitch and tremble as if she
is running, chasing sheep through heather and bracken. This time, however, she dreams a most
peculiar dream.

Lassie dreams that she is falling, slowly, gracefully, like an outsized snowflake, drifting to the
ground. Round and round she twirls, until she lands, on all fours. This is odd. She is not a cat,
and for a moment has to reassure herself that she is all in one piece. A long --- she is not sure how
to describe it --- corridor? tunnel? passage? --- stretches out in front of her. Given that there is
no way for Lassie to climb back up, she decides to go forward, tentatively, slowly, sniffing the air
as she goes. She thinks it may be an old rabbit burrow, but there is no scent or sound of rabbits,
and an odd smell --- something like glue or resin. The walls of the burrow are patterned with black
and white swirls and flowers, and their are fancy-looking crystal chandeliers hanging from the
ceiling. Lassie comes to a halt. This is most irregular. Rabbits have no need for wallpaper, and
they have not mastered the art of glass cutting. However, Lassie’s curiosity is piqued, and she
carries on. In front of her is an octopus. Clearly, an octopus is not the first living soul that you
would expect to find in a burrow, but there it is, clear as day, sitting on an elegant three-legged
stool without a care in the world. As Lassie approaches, the octopus pays her no mind, and just
carries on with the task with which it is engaged: painting the claws of a three-toed sloth with
bright red nail varnish. The sloth has a look of utter bliss on its green furry face as it hangs
from one of the chandeliers, offering a claw at a time to the octopus. Lassie is completely
flummoxed. She does not know whether to stop for a while and get her own claws painted, or to move
on, pretending not to notice. She goes for the latter choice, and pads her way further underground.

For the next 100 metres or so, nothing is untoward. The burrow seems to be the common-all-garden
rabbit variety with a sandy floor and earthen walls. Lassie’s nose twitches. Fire! She can smell
fire! And yet, weirdly, she feels no fear, and has no compulsion to run back the way she came. Quite
the opposite: she moves forward. The burrow gets gradually wider, until it opens out into what seems
to be a small cave. Stalagmites and stalactites in bright jewel colours adorn the floor and
ceiling. Lassie finds the source of the smell: in the centre of the cave is a campfire, and either
side of it, toasting fluffy pink marshmallows at the end of sticks, are two sharks. Lassie nearly
falls over as she stops in her tracks. Her first thought is to run as fast as she can, but as she
looks more closely, she sees that these sharks have barely any teeth, and are happily munching their
(now toasted) marshmallows with their gums. Clearly, fish and crustaceans have become too much for
these elderly sharks, and they can only manage soft foods with their reduced ability to bite
anything tougher than a marshmallow. Lassie is grateful that they don’t look up as she scurries
past.

The passage narrows again, and Lassie wonders what other strange animals might inhabit this bizarre
world. She’s not left wondering for long. Fairy lights now twinkle and sparkle along the ceiling,
and the ground is covered with rag-rugs. Seated at a wooden card table are a mouse and a
mole. Between them is a checkers board. The checkers board looks regular enough: black and white
squares, but the checkers themselves are not so regular. Instead of the black and white wooden discs
there are little chunks of white cheese and over-sized blackberries. The mouse is yelling something
at the mole, but Lassie cannot make out what. In response, the mole takes a blackberry, but instead
of moving it across the board, he pops it into his mouth. Again, the mouse yells at him, but the
mole pays him no heed. Evidently, he can see perfectly well, but is as deaf as a post. In response,
the loudest mouse that ever lived takes a piece of cheese/checker and starts to nibble on it. Before
long, the board is cleared of checkers, and the mole and mouse sit happily replete after their
supper. Lassie wonders how on earth these two manage to get to the end of a game. She also wonders
how on earth she will get out of this burrow.  On she goes. The burrow begins to twist and turn and
Lassie is anxious to know what might be around the next corner. Around the next corner is a beast. A
huge beast, that has Lassie cowering on the floor. It is a sheep. Specifically, a black-faced sheep,
that is the size of an elephant. And it is charging towards her with its tail up and its head
down. Lassie (being a smart dog, and used to out-witting sheep) realises she has a chance to
escape. She gets to her feet, and runs as fast as her legs will carry her between the sheep’s gangly
legs. She runs for her life, desperate to get home…”Lassie, come home!” she hears a voice --- it’s
Joe! He’s stroking her coat and calling to her. Lassie opens her eyes. And wags her tail. The
nightmare is over and she is safely home in front of the fire. Time for supper.
