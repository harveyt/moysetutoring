Tell me everything will be OK.  
Question me when I complain ---  
Ask me what I'm proud of (I won't tell you).  

Remind me of the truth when I despair.  
Call me out on pride and puffed-up-iness;  
Advise me of grace: I'm quick to judge.  
Alert me to criticism that is unwarranted.  

Warn me when I wander too far;  
Notify me when it's OK to come out.  

Wonder at my wanderings (all over the map).  
Stand for my understanding - where I stand;  
Accept that my shortcomings are not short.  

Endure with my sadness, as it endures;  
Remember that my memory is jumpy.  
Care for my distress though it is stressful.  

Delight in my lightness, though it is heavy.  
Believe for my beliefs, my conviction, my victory.  
Step through my life carefully, deliberately:  
Look for my horizons, my far-off home.
