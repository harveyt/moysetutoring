      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl in the red-and-white striped dress sits at the front of the class, right-hand side,
opposite the blue door. Absorbed in her thoughts, she chews the end of her pencil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is Wednesday evening, and the eager Brownie Guide is making her way down the hill to the Baptist
church hall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl sits crosslegged on the classroom floor, listening to “Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat”. She
twiddles her hair, bewitched by the clever, whimsical poem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The seven year-old girl in the grey pinafore dress is painting. With yellow and blue poster paints,
sugar paper and cereal boxes, she is creating the backdrop for her seaside model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl with the milk-pale skin is paddling in the cold water of the English Channel,
daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nine-year-old girl is sitting cross-legged on the parquet floor of the school hall, upset by the
scenes of wretched housing in filthy streets. She wants someone to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl in the worn-out plimsols is posing for a photograph. She stands stiffly, gracelessly,
trying to look serious and authentic. It is not working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The child with the allergy to all things feathered is sitting in the back of the car, thumb in her
mouth and notebook on her lap, looking out for the sign for the border.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

for a holiday memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl with the too-short hair cut makes her way down the dirt path. She is taking the short cut
beside the football pitch; it peters out at the edge of the sea loch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The asthmatic girl is climbing her way up the 287 steps of the Scott Monument in Edinburgh: her
chest is tight and her lungs are straining, but she is determined to get to the top.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Big man, beaming toothless.
Lurching lumpily onto the bus,
Bags crunching and rattling
With cans and bottles,
Pleased with his meagre treasure
Takes up the whole back seat,
Chatting away to himself.
Old man, withered and worn,
Scrawny legs crossed on the bus
Squirming uncomfortably
Spluttering and coughing
He has no handkerchief;
Glutinous spit propelled
With every heave of his lungs.
Young man, unsteady on his feet,
Clambers doggedly onto the bus</description>

      <title>Baggage</title>

      <description>History and all that clan malarky.
You can take it or leave it.
I&amp;rsquo;d rather leave it if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind.
Too cumbersome to carry about,
like having to manoeuvre a four-tier wedding cake
whilst running for the bus in sky-high stilettos.
Like wearing lip-gloss in a howling gale,
it just gets irritating and awkward.
Having to remember this and ponder on that,
and try to work out who&amp;rsquo;s who and who&amp;rsquo;s not.</description>

      <title>Synaesthesia</title>
      <link>http://www.moysetutoring.ca/post/syn/</link>

      <description>Vision is always synaesthetic.
Impure, permeable, blurry.
Other senses come creeping in,
unwelcome and bad-tempered,
not wiping their feet and demanding cups of tea.
Ear-plugs don’t work.
Sounds wiggle their way around the latex
to remind you of what was said,
what music was playing.
A taste forms in your mouth.
Is that coffee? Caramel perhaps.
It’s on the tip of your tongue.
Perhaps it isn’t a taste at all.</description>
