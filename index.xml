      <description>1979
Thursday at 7pm is Daphne’s weekly hair appointment. She sits at JoJohn’s examining the backs of her hands. She has to move her hands towards her face as she cannot move her head: Eileen is giving her blonde streaks this evening, so she must keep still. As Eileen pulls strands of hair through the rubber cap with a crochet hook, Daphne tries not to flinch, and focusses on her hands instead.</description>

      <description>The girl in the red-and-white striped dress sits at the front of the class, right-hand side, opposite the blue door. Absorbed in her thoughts, she chews the end of her pencil.
 ❦ 
Her desk is next to a large locked cupboard, that holds teacher bits and pieces and extra reading books. Mrs. H&amp;mdash; is unnerving. Clearly, I have done something to annoy her, but I don’t know what, but I am six years old, so adults are a mystery.</description>

      <description>Lizzy’s heard it all before. Busy Lizzy. Frizzy Lizzy. Dizzy Lizzy… and that’s just the nicknames. Having been born in the same year as Queen Elizabeth’s coronation, her name was an obvious choice, but she wishes that her parents had used a little more imagination when it came to christening their daughter. There had been two other girls with the same name in her class at primary school: Elizabeth, Lizzy and Bess.</description>

      <description>It is Wednesday evening, and the eager Brownie Guide is making her way down the hill to the Baptist church hall.
 ❦ 
I quite like my Brownie uniform: brown dress, brown beret and yellow cross-over tie. I go on my own now, since my sisters have both progressed up to Guides. Besides, I am now seven, and perfectly capable of making the fifteen minute walk by myself. There is only one busy road to cross, by the pub: “Look right, look left, look right again, all clear?</description>

      <description>Elizabeth sits in the kitchen of her modest ground-floor flat. She sips her coffee and tries to read the morning paper, but the print wobbles and wavers. She can’t focus. She wonders why she still has The Guardian delivered, since it’s all online these days. Habit, she supposes. There is something satisfying about going to the newsagent each week and paying her newspaper bill. She has had the same Saturday routine for as long as she can remember: brisk walk around the green, back via the newsagent and bakery for a weekend treat.</description>

      <description>The girl sits crosslegged on the classroom floor, listening to “Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat”. She twiddles her hair, bewitched by the clever, whimsical poem.
 ❦ 
Our classroom is outside the main school building. It is pre-fab, and probably not intended for long-term use; it seems to have decided to put down roots and take up permanent residence. There are two classrooms separated by a small hallway, where we can hang our coats.</description>

      <description>Brenda sits on the front pew of the crematorium. She’s glad that only her son and daughter-in-law can see her face. She sits, her back ram-rod straight, with her hands in her lap, clutching the Order of Service and a balled-up Kleenex. She is trying to focus on the words of the minister: “Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed…” She thinks: he wasn’t a dear brother and I’m not sure Almighty God will be at all pleased to find him rattling the bars of the pearly gates.</description>

      <description>The seven year-old girl in the grey pinafore dress is painting. With yellow and blue poster paints, sugar paper and cereal boxes, she is creating the backdrop for her seaside model.
 ❦ 
I’m sad to leave Mrs. S&amp;mdash;’s classroom. It has been a sanctuary for me: Mrs. S&amp;mdash; is sweet and kind; it’s like being taught by a favourite granny. She has white hair tied in a wispy bun and reading glasses on a chain, that she peers over to make sure we are paying attention to her as she reads us stories.</description>

      <description>With apologies to Walter Benjamin
Wivelsfield, Burgess Hill, Hassocks. Cathy notes the the names of the stations as they go past. Wivelsfield. What’s a Wivel? Is there a whole field of them? Or has the apostrophe been mislaid along the way and there is a field belonging to a Mr. Wivel on which the station was built? Perhaps a Mrs. Wivel cut the ribbon to open the ticket office. Wivelsfield, Burgess and Hassocks.</description>

      <description>The girl with the milk-pale skin is paddling in the cold water of the English Channel, daydreaming.
 ❦ 
Our great aunt and uncle live in Hastings. We go and visit them every few months, and sometimes stay for a few days. Great Aunt Ruth has steel grey hair: no-nonsense pudding basin cut. Probably done with a pudding basin. She stoops as if she has dropped something in front of her, and shuffles in her sensible shoes from kitchen to dining room.</description>

      <description>With thanks to Tarea
Alex closes her laptop with a groan. Her Eng. Lit. 201 essay is just not coming together and it’s getting late. She should get herself home, but there is just time to drop into Scott’s Pantry for a cup of tea and a chip butty. She is in need of comfort food, and nothing beats a chip butty on a damp autumn evening. It’s been a long shift at the university library and she is still no further forward with her research paper: Choose two characters from Shakespeare’s tragedies and provide an argument on how they might represent his personal views on a topic.</description>

      <description>The nine-year-old girl is sitting cross-legged on the parquet floor of the school hall, upset by the scenes of wretched housing in filthy streets. She wants someone to do something about it.
 ❦ 
The start of the new school year is heralded by the smell of varnish: the floor of the school hall is always resurfaced over the summer holidays, but it is scuffed and scratched within a week.</description>

      <description>Gill is making up the guest bed. She wishes she could be a bit more enthusiastic, put a little more heart into her task. No whistling while she works. Instead she is wrestling with the duvet cover. She has bought a new set especially for this visit: crisp white cotton from Marks and Spencer, washed and ironed with extra care and attention, knowing that her visitor is very exacting about such matters.</description>

      <description>The girl in the worn-out plimsols is posing for a photograph. She stands stiffly, gracelessly, trying to look serious and authentic. It is not working.
 ❦ 
I am in my second year in Mrs. R&amp;mdash;’s classroom and we are studying French. Our lessons are on scratchy 45rpm records; we listen carefully to the strange sounds and words, following along in our booklets. Mrs. R&amp;mdash; has a student teacher helping her this year.</description>

      <description>1973
Arthur sits at the end of his bed, tying his shoelaces. He is taking his time. He’s had a quiet morning listening to the radio and treating himself to a chapter or two of his new book: a thoughtful Christmas gift from his nephew - the life of Alexander the Great. But now, he must get himself ready to go over to his sister’s house for Boxing Day. It’s a tradition that has been going on for more years than he cares to remember.</description>

Our two week holiday to Scotland every August starts in the same way. Everything is sorted and packed well in advance into our somewhat scruffy, somewhat tired suitcases. The fridge is cleared out and the door propped open.</description>

 ❦ 
We leave Greenock to catch the ferry to Dunoon; mercifully, the crossing is short and the waves not too choppy, since, not only am I frequently car-sick, I am also prone to boat-sickness as well. This time around the sun is doing its best to peek around the skitty cotton-wool clouds.</description>

      <description>Joe is peeling potatoes. He fancies a bit of vegetable pie for supper, so he is working on some fine looking Maris Peers that he’s grown from a handful that he bought in his local supermarket. Growing potatoes seems like magic to Joe, and the whole process brings him pleasure. The shop-bought potatoes had sprouted nicely, sitting sentry-like on the window sill in egg boxes. He still uses the tried-and-tested trench method his grandad showed him years ago, and this year’s crop has been excellent.</description>

      <description>Swoosh. The train glides along the tracks, as if, well… as if it is on rails. Tom finds the sound hard to describe in his mind. “Swoosh” is not quite right; more like a quiet Tie Fighter, perhaps. A Tie Fighter with laryngitis? He is bored. The mystery paperback he picked up at Euston is not at all, “A gripping mystery perfect for fans of Agatha Christie” as it was advertised.</description>

Patricia is off on a little excursion. It is coming up to her birthday, and for a treat she is going to take afternoon tea at the Spa Hotel. It’s not often Patricia splashes out; after all, she must look after the pennies so that the pounds that make up her modest pension take care of themselves. Patricia (and it is Patricia, please note, not Pat, or Heaven forbid, Patty) lives frugally, ensuring that she stays within her grocery budget and making sure she keeps a check on the heating bill.</description>

      <description>Peter puts the phone down. He is troubled and disquieted by the twenty-minute conversation he has just had with this older brother, David. He pours himself a generous glass of Glenfiddich and sits back down in his armchair.
As they have aged, the two brothers seem to have grown apart. He can’t remember when this germ of greed in his brother turned into such ugly clutching and grasping. Where did it come from?</description>

His father’s funeral is tomorrow, so he is spending the day sorting through his father’s belongings. Ben is the trustee of David’s estate, and although he is getting support and guidance from his Uncle Peter, he is finding the whole process both and daunting and depressing.</description>

He has his fish paste sandwiches stuffed in one pocket and a scruffy paperback in the other.</description>

      <description>A nonsense story for Andy.
Lassie is dog-tired. But, being a dog (specifically a collie) that’s not unexpected. She’s worn out from an afternoon of herding sheep. Specifically, black-faced sheep. She lopes along next to Mr and Mrs McTavish and their son, Joe. No-one speaks, as no-one (including Lassie) has the energy to converse, be it in words, growls or barks. Lassie’s tail is jammed between her legs, and her sable coat is splashed with peaty rain.</description>

John is off on a jaunt. It’s a fair April day, and he fancies a trip to the seaside. He’s partial to Whitby with its eccentricities and weird history. The drive should take around an hour, but he’s planning to stop along the way. Take his time. Savour the landscape. Enjoy a bit of fresh air.
Retirement suits John well. He’s made a bit of money, a nest-egg so to speak, and has few financial concerns.</description>

With thanks to Mona
Ronald looks at his watch. 12.30. His next tutorial session is not until 3pm, so he has time for a leisurely lunch. He is not looking forward to his afternoon appointment with Chadwick: his student’s PhD thesis, loosely entitled “The Monsters and Beowulf”, is dull and uninspired. Even the title is hackneyed. Ronald finds it hard to focus as Chadwick earnestly tries to justify his proposal; his flat voice and pedestrian thinking drain Ronald of any enthusiasm so Chadwick’s blathering goes in one ear and swiftly out of the other.</description>

Ginny is trotting down to the beach to have a swim. It’s a warmish July day; a few clouds in the sky and a distinct possibly of rain later, so she is making a dash for it before the drizzle begins. It’s been a bewildering few days and she needs to clear her head. Swimming will be just the thing: a few laps back and forth while the sea is not too choppy.</description>

      <description>Big man, beaming toothless.
Lurching lumpily onto the bus,
Bags crunching and rattling
With cans and bottles,
Pleased with his meagre treasure
Takes up the whole back seat,
Chatting away to himself.
Old man, withered and worn,
Scrawny legs crossed on the bus
Squirming uncomfortably
Spluttering and coughing
He has no handkerchief;
Glutinous spit propelled
With every heave of his lungs.
Young man, unsteady on his feet,
Clambers doggedly onto the bus</description>

      <description>History and all that clan malarky.
You can take it or leave it.
I&amp;rsquo;d rather leave it if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind.
Too cumbersome to carry about,
like having to manoeuvre a four-tier wedding cake
whilst running for the bus in sky-high stilettos.
Like wearing lip-gloss in a howling gale,
it just gets irritating and awkward.
Having to remember this and ponder on that,
and try to work out who&amp;rsquo;s who and who&amp;rsquo;s not.</description>

      <title>Synaesthesia</title>

      <description>Vision is always synaesthetic.
Impure, permeable, blurry.
Other senses come creeping in,
unwelcome and bad-tempered,
not wiping their feet and demanding cups of tea.
Ear-plugs don’t work.
Sounds wiggle their way around the latex
to remind you of what was said,
what music was playing.
A taste forms in your mouth.
Is that coffee? Caramel perhaps.
It’s on the tip of your tongue.
Perhaps it isn’t a taste at all.</description>
