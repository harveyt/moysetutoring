      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl in the red-and-white striped dress sits at the front of the class, right-hand side,
opposite the blue door. Absorbed in her thoughts, she chews the end of her pencil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is Wednesday evening, and the eager Brownie Guide is making her way down the hill to the Baptist
church hall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl sits crosslegged on the classroom floor, listening to “Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat”. She
twiddles her hair, bewitched by the clever, whimsical poem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The seven year-old girl in the grey pinafore dress is painting. With yellow and blue poster paints,
sugar paper and cereal boxes, she is creating the backdrop for her seaside model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nine-year-old girl is sitting cross-legged on the parquet floor of the school hall, upset by the
scenes of wretched housing in filthy streets. She wants someone to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl in the worn-out plimsols is posing for a photograph. She stands stiffly, gracelessly,
trying to look serious and authentic. It is not working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The child with the allergy to all things feathered is sitting in the back of the car, thumb in her
mouth and notebook on her lap, looking out for the sign for the border.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl with the bunch of purple heather sits on the side of the hill overlooking the loch, posing
for a holiday memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The girl with the too-short hair cut makes her way down the dirt path. She is taking the short cut
beside the football pitch; it peters out at the edge of the sea loch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The asthmatic girl is climbing her way up the 287 steps of the Scott Monument in Edinburgh: her
chest is tight and her lungs are straining, but she is determined to get to the top.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>With grateful thanks to Miss Brill.
Patricia is off on a little excursion. It is coming up to her birthday, and for a treat she is going to take afternoon tea at the Spa Hotel. It’s not often Patricia splashes out; after all, she must look after the pennies so that the pounds that make up her modest pension take care of themselves. Patricia (and it is Patricia, please note, not Pat, or Heaven forbid, Patty) lives frugally, ensuring that she stays within her grocery budget and making sure she keeps a check on the heating bill.</description>

      <description>1931
Ronald looks at his watch. 12.30. His next tutorial session is not until 3pm, so he has time for a leisurely lunch. He is not looking forward to his afternoon appointment with Chadwick: his student’s PhD thesis, that is loosely entitled “The Monsters and Beowulf”, is dull and uninspired. Even the title is hackneyed. Ronald finds it hard to focus as Chadwick earnestly tries to justify his proposal, but Chadwick’s flat voice and pedestrian thinking drains Ronald of any enthusiasm and his blathering goes in one ear and swiftly out of the other.</description>

      <description>Brenda sits on the front pew of the crematorium. She’s glad that only her son and daughter-in-law can see her face. She sits, her back ram-rod straight, with her hands in her lap, clutching the Order of Service and a balled up Kleenex. She is trying to focus on the words of the minister: “Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed…” She thinks, he wasn’t a dear brother and I’m not sure Almighty God will be at all pleased to find him rattling the bars of the pearly gates.</description>

      <description>Lizzy’s heard it all before. Busy Lizzy. Frizzy Lizzy. Dizzy Lizzy… and that’s just the nicknames. Having been born in the same year as Queen Elizabeth’s coronation, her name was an obvious choice, but she wishes that her parents had used a little more imagination when it came to christening their daughter. There had been two other Elizabeths in her class at primary school: Elizabeth, Lizzy and Bess. So that her teacher (Mrs.</description>

      <description>Duncan is taking his lunch break. He checks in with Cathy, the supermarket manager: “That’s me on lunch, now.” “Right you are, Duncan.” He hangs his apron on his peg in the staff room and takes his wind-cheater. It’s a fine June day, but there’s still a stiff breeze coming off the river. He takes a little detour, going down the steps towards the esplanade. He has his fish paste sandwiches stuffed in one pocket and a scruffy paperback in the other.</description>

      <description>Big man, beaming toothless.
Lurching lumpily onto the bus,
Bags crunching and rattling
With cans and bottles,
Pleased with his meagre treasure
Takes up the whole back seat,
Chatting away to himself.
Old man, withered and worn,
Scrawny legs crossed on the bus
Squirming uncomfortably
Spluttering and coughing
He has no handkerchief;
Glutinous spit propelled
With every heave of his lungs.
Young man, unsteady on his feet,
Clambers doggedly onto the bus</description>

      <description>History and all that clan malarky.
You can take it or leave it.
I&amp;rsquo;d rather leave it if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind.
Too cumbersome to carry about,
like having to manoeuvre a four-tier wedding cake
whilst running for the bus in sky-high stilettos.
Like wearing lip-gloss in a howling gale,
it just gets irritating and awkward.
Having to remember this and ponder on that,
and try to work out who&amp;rsquo;s who and who&amp;rsquo;s not.</description>

      <title>Synaesthesia</title>
      <link>http://www.moysetutoring.ca/post/syn/</link>

      <description>Vision is always synaesthetic.
Impure, permeable, blurry.
Other senses come creeping in,
unwelcome and bad-tempered,
not wiping their feet and demanding cups of tea.
Ear-plugs don’t work.
Sounds wiggle their way around the latex
to remind you of what was said,
what music was playing.
A taste forms in your mouth.
Is that coffee? Caramel perhaps.
It’s on the tip of your tongue.
Perhaps it isn’t a taste at all.</description>
