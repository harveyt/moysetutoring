		  <h1>Peter</h1>
		  <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
Who said&mdash;&ldquo;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p>
<p>Peter puts the phone down. He is troubled and disquieted by the twenty-minute conversation he has
just had with this brother, David. He sighs, pours himself a generous glass of Glenfiddich and sits
back down in his armchair. As they have aged, the two brothers seem to have grown apart. He can&rsquo;t
remember what it was that planted this germ of greed in his brother that has turned into such ugly
clutching and grasping. Where did it come from? He takes a sip of his whisky and sighs again. They
came from respectable lower-middle-class stock; dependable, caring parents. As children they were
poor as church mice, but not destitute. Life got better. The linoleum was replaced by wall-to-wall
carpet, and the coal fires by central heating. Their mother&rsquo;s make-do-and-mend philosophy meant that
they had what they needed, although not always what they wanted.</p>
<p>They have both done reasonably well in their chosen careers, both now &ldquo;comfortably off&rdquo; as their
mother would have described it. Sadly, it seems as if David has become the epitome of &ldquo;knowing the
price of everything but the value of nothing.&rdquo; He had phoned &mdash; yet again &mdash; to complain that
their cousin has ownership of their grandfather&rsquo;s ceremonial sword from his time in the Navy. Peter
couldn&rsquo;t care less, but this slight (as he sees it) gnaws away at David, who claims that the antique
is worth a fortune and that their cousin snatched it without asking. David insists that it should
have been given to him since he had also served in the Navy. Peter has a good relationship with this
cousin, and knows him to be a very decent man; as such, he believes that the sword is in safe hands
and will never be sold. David is adamant that he is right, and refuses to be persuaded otherwise.
Peter just listens, offering no judgement or agreement, interjecting with the occasional &ldquo;Mmmmm&rdquo; or
non-committal &ldquo;Aha&hellip;&rdquo;; he knows from experience not to bother arguing with him. Might as well talk
to the cat, he thinks. Peter drains his glass, rinses it out and makes his weary way up to bed.</p>
<p>After a less-than peaceful night&rsquo;s sleep, Peter is feeling wrung out. He knows the conversation with
his brother has unsettled him, and the day&rsquo;s news is no comfort. He folds his newspaper and sighs.
How did politics become this polarised? What has happened to public discourse? Why is it so hard
these days for people to accept that another person&rsquo;s world view might not be their own? Peter gets
up stiffly from his breakfast table and walks with his cereal bowl and coffee mug to the sink. He
sighs again. He looks out onto the handkerchief-sized garden at the daffodils just starting to poke
through the cold, late-winter earth. The sun is struggling to come through, but here and there the
cloud is thin enough to allow a few rays of feeble sunlight to warm the grateful soil. He thinks
about his wife, who planted the daffodil bulbs several years ago, and is glad that she did. He sighs
again as he drys off the breakfast things with a tea towel, and replaces them back in the cupboard.
Checking his watch, he takes his heavy winter coat and woollen scarf from the newel post at the
bottom of the stairs, and heads out.</p>
<p>Peter sits on the near-empty train on its way into London; he&rsquo;s caught the semi-fast, and so should
be at Charing Cross by 11am or so. He&rsquo;s left his newspaper at home, and is quite content to watch
the world go by as he travels through the dreary inter-war suburbs to the city centre. In his mind
he revisits some of the reporting from the morning paper. At one time he would have agreed with the
oft-repeated phrase that, &ldquo;it was better back then&rdquo;, but on reflection he realises he was mistaken.
What he had been remembering was what it was like to be in his 20s: his whole life ahead of him, few
responsibilities to burden him, and fewer sorrows to weigh on his heart. So much time to waste! He
knows it wasn&rsquo;t better back then, it was just different. And he knows that he must not become
embittered by what irks him about his life now, including his brother&rsquo;s carping and complaining. He
casts his mind back to the awful days of power blackouts and three-day weeks, the months of alarming
inflation that made penny-pinching an art form in his family. He thinks about the dreary,
second-rate television with its casual racism and patronising commentary. He sighs.</p>
<p>Peter heads towards the underground station: since it is still chilly outside, he takes the Northern
Line to Tottenham Court Road, and walks the rest of the way to the British Museum. It is a building
with which he is familiar; when he worked in central London he would often spend a lunch hour or
some time after close of business at a museum or art gallery just to clear his head and put his
concerns into perspective. Today, he decides to visit Ramasses II, the subject of Shelly&rsquo;s famous
poem about the Egyptian pharaoh. Ramasses, aka Ozymandias, towers above the rest of the exhibits,
with a half-smile on his lips, seemingly amused by the whole spectacle. He&rsquo;s bruised and battered: a
hole in the right of his chest is a memento from an attempt to raise him from the sands long ago;
his body is cracked and his crown is broken. A group of school children &mdash; perhaps eight or nine
years-old &mdash; are currently crowded around the huge granite torso, each drawing their own version
of the piece. They work with heads bowed and pencils scratching, like a clutch of slaves bowing to
the god-like pharaoh. One lad, bored of his task, looks out and catches Peter&rsquo;s eye. Peter nods
slightly in acknowledgement and carries on down the gallery.</p>
<p>Sitting in the Court Cafe, enjoying a hot cup of tea and a slice of lemon cake, Peter considers
Ramasses. He thinks that the Egyptians were wise not to shun death, but to embrace it as part and
parcel of life. He remembers the famous lines: &ldquo;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!&rdquo;, but
Peter is not despairing. Not in the least: a smile, not dissimilar to that of Ozymandias&rsquo;, appears
on his face. Of course. Ramasses, once so powerful, so sure that he was right, so enamoured of his
own achievements is nothing but a shrivelled mummy; his colossal statue is broken in two, and
displayed in a museum for school kids to ignore. This gives Peter a little hope and a lot more
perspective. Political leaders come and go, treasures rot and turn to dust, but the human heart,
with all its frailties and foibles, goes on. As Peter leaves, he passes the granite Pharaoh. He
gives him a quick salute, and heads towards home.</p>
