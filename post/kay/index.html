		  <h1>Kay</h1>
		  <h2 id="1985">1985</h2>
<p>Kay is on the plane to Malaga. She is on her second mini bottle of Teacher&rsquo;s scotch, knocking back
the first one in two gulps, just to steady her nerves. The second one is lasting a bit longer, now
that she has relaxed a bit. Plus, she has realised that the plane is not going to drop from the sky
like a stone, and the pilot seems to know what he/she is doing. Kay has never been on an airplane
before, and is beginning to like the idea. She&rsquo;s pleased that the seat next to her is unoccupied,
for two reasons. One, she doesn&rsquo;t want to be stuck with a chatty Patty for three hours and twenty
minutes, and two, she can stretch out a bit and keep her bag on the seat beside her. She&rsquo;s bought
herself a roomy straw tote bag for all her bibs and bobs, that will double up as a handy beach bag
when she gets to Benalmadena.</p>
<p>Kay has planned this holiday since Christmas, daydreaming of warm rain-free days as she stacks the
grocery shelves in her local supermarket. She&rsquo;d been able to swing some overtime (thanks to her
lovely manager, Brian) and has scrimped and scraped for months to pay for a week&rsquo;s holiday in Sunny
Spain. She&rsquo;d seen the advert in the back of the Radio Times on Boxing Day, whilst at her parent&rsquo;s
home. As an only child, Christmases have never been a grand affair: turkey and Christmas pudding,
watching the Queen&rsquo;s speech wearing the crêpe-paper hats from the crackers. Whilst her parents dozed
through <em>Escape to Victory</em> on BBC1, Kay had leafed through the holiday section when a small advert
caught her eye: &ldquo;Self-catering studio flat, Benalmadena, Costa del Sol. Complex has private swimming
pool. 10 minutes from beach.&rdquo; Kay let her thoughts wander a bit. Within days she had sent a cheque
for the deposit, and booked her flight at the local travel agent, and applied for a passport. Her
parents were none too impressed, her mother asking, in disbelief, &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s wrang wi' Ayr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had felt quite giddy, not quite knowing what had overcome her at the time, but now that she is
on her way at last, she is so pleased she took the plunge and ignored her mother&rsquo;s grumbling. Kay
wonders what the weather will be like. Well, at least it will be warmer than the west coast of
Scotland, where summer in Ayr means dodging the rain showers and the midges. What about the food?
She&rsquo;s got her Spanish-English dictionary so that she can buy basics for the week, and with a few
pesetas left over for souvenirs or Duty Free. Her mum is quite worried for her, convinced that water
in Spain is not fit to drink and the streets not safe to walk. Kay has to admit she&rsquo;s a little
concerned about landing late in the evening, but she has been told that she can get a taxi from the
airport to the flat, so there is no need for concern.</p>
<p>Stepping out of Malaga airport, Kay stops for a moment and closes her eyes. The evening air is warm
and welcoming; it has a quality that she cannot put her finger on. Like being wrapped in a woolly
blanket on a cold night, snuggly and comforting. The taxi driver knows her destination well, and
points her to a notice in English letting her know that there is a flat rate for fares from the
airport to her destination. She thanks him in hesitant Spanish as he places her suitcase in the boot
and opens the door for her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not long before they arrive outside Edifico Iris: Kay pays the driver (adding a generous tip)
and approaches the reception desk. She is greeted by Isabel, who is both fluent in English and good
at her job; within a few minutes Kay is clutching a set of keys and on her way to the fifth floor in
a somewhat rickety lift. The corridor is quiet and Kay&rsquo;s sandals click-clack along the tiled floor
to apartment 508, which is just as advertised: small, but brightly painted and decorated with a
galley kitchen and pull-down bed. &ldquo;Home&rdquo; thinks Kay, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m home.&rdquo;</p>
