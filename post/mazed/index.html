		  <p>The girl in the red-and-white striped dress sits at the front of the class, right-hand side,
opposite the blue door. Absorbed in her thoughts, she chews the end of her pencil.</p>

<p>Her desk is next to a large locked cupboard, that holds teacher bits and pieces and extra reading
books. Mrs. H&mdash; is unnerving. Clearly, I have done something to annoy her, but I
don<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>t know what, but I am six years old, so adults are a mystery. Her mouth
makes an ugly turn down when she speaks to me. I know I have erred in some way, but I have not been
informed of my mistake and I cannot put it right. Mrs. H&mdash; has favourites. Sadly, I am not in this
happy band and I resent the ones who are petted and praised. I am not approved of, not gathered into
her wiry, red-woollen arms. I sit on my own at a desk for two until a new girl joins our class.
She<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s casually spiteful, and throws my school-issued pack of coloured pencils
behind the teacher<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s cupboard. I have no idea what to do: rendered mute,
immobile. I cannot think of the words to explain what has happened, and don<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>t
know how to get my pencils back. I do my best to explain my predicament to Mrs. H&mdash;, but my account
does not make any sense to her and she dismisses me with a flick of her wrist.</p>
<p>Numbers and words scrape and scratch their way across the blackboard in dusty chalk, but I can make
little sense of them. I beaver away in my exercise book: the cover is blue; the top half of page
plain for drawing, bottom half lined for writing. The ends of my pencils are chewed to shreds from
my bite marks. I want my work to look neat and tidy, but all to often my writing wanders around the
page like a cow in a field, and the corners are dog-eared and tatty. I try to smooth them down, but
they keep curling back up. I do my best to write my <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>news&quot;, but I have little
imagination and am impaired by the anxiety that takes up half of my thinking; it seems my brain is
filled with kapok, or perhaps it is just stuck, as if the cogs haven<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>t had
enough oil and are jammed, stuttering and faltering. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>ve added a new tactic
to help appease the constant drip-drip of fear in my thoughts: chewing tiny holes in my pinafore
skirt. I nibble whilst no-one is looking, the nip-snip of the threads between my teeth is somehow
comforting. Mum thinks we have moths, and I have managed to persuade her that this is the correct
analysis. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m pleased with my small victory.</p>
<p>My mother provides me with homemade clothes for school: the regulation red-and-white striped summer
dresses are created at the dining room table with an old Singer machine. She likes to make us
matching Victorian bloomers using the same material. She believes them to be charming, but
I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m humiliated, and want to have normal knickers from Marks and Spencer like
everyone else. We have regulation navy knickers and white vests for PE: one week I forget to bring
mine, and have to do PE in my ridiculous bloomers. I hike them up as best I can, but they, of
course, get attention, and I blush and squirm my way through thirty dreadful minutes of pretending
to be a tree in the wind and a bird hopping between branches.</p>
<p>The school year goes past in a colourless monotony. Days are tediously predictable:
assembly-class-break-class-dinner-class-home. I like school lunches. We have good-natured dinner
ladies, who prepare tasty meals. I especially like the lady who serves the salad.
<span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>Beetroot?&quot; she always asks. Lunch breaks are made easier by my sweet friend,
J&mdash;, who is from another form. We spend our time performing pretend weather forecasts in front of
a blue door, where the paint has peeled to roughly the shape of the British Isles.</p>
<p>Back at my desk, I have little to write in my <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>news&quot; book: our Monday
afternoon exercise, in which we write about our week. I chew the end of my pencil and consider my
options. Little flakes of yellow paint come off and get stuck to my tongue; I spit them out into my
white cotton hanky, trying not to draw Mrs. H&mdash;&rsquo;s scrutiny. Our books are collected at the end of
class by a book monitor: an accolade I can never reach. It is an honour only bestowed on one of Mrs.
H&mdash;&rsquo;s favourites. However, towards the end of the year I finally have something interesting to
write for my <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>news&quot; book.</p>
<p>It had been a average day at Hastings, home to my great aunt and uncle. We had driven down in the
white Austin 1100: Mum and dog in the passenger seat, Dad, of course, driving, three sisters on the
back seat with the picnic basket and thermos flasks tucked under our feet. We parked on the Marina,
near to the Warrior Square gardens, and made our way down to the beach with all our paraphernalia.
Decked out a hand-me-down swimsuit and towelling tabards, I played on the pebbly beach most of the
day, doing my best to avoid the tar from a recent oil spill. Inevitably we got blobs of the sticky
black goop on our flip-flops and towels, malevolent treacle that we had to clean off later with a
special solution. We paddled and splashed around the stone groynes; we are all strong swimmers. Even
if my English composition is lacklustre, at least I can do two widths breaststroke. I have the green
patch sewn on to my swimming costume to prove it. Somehow, suddenly, both of my sisters managed to
swim over the top of groyne and fell in the other side, where the water was much deeper. Although
they could have swum back, they panicked, and my dad had to rescue them both. It happened in a
moment. Watching from the water<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s edge, I had been astounded by how quickly
this was over and done. I stood with my mouth open, reflecting later to my sisters that I was
<span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>amazed.&quot; My mother mis-heard this, and, as she related the story to friends
and family, she quoted me as saying, <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>I was mazed.&quot; I said nothing of the
sort, but grinned along, since it got me attention for being cute &mdash; a novelty for me.</p>
<p>I try this new trick with Mrs. H&mdash;, hoping it will elicit the same affectionate smiles. Carefully,
I draw the incident with stick figures and coloured pencils, and write a few sentences ending with,
<span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>I was mazed.&quot; I hope that this will mean that Mrs. H&mdash; will look on me more
kindly, perhaps give me one of her coveted gold stars. But I am mistaken. My exercise book comes
back, corrected, with a red biro <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>a&quot; in front of the
<span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>mazed&quot;.</p>
