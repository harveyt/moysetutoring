		  <h1>Tom</h1>
		  <p><strong>Tom thinks about childhood holidays.</strong></p>

<p>Swoosh. The train glides along the tracks, as if is on&hellip; well, rails. Tom finds the sound hard to
describe in his mind. Swoosh is not quite right; more like a quiet tie fighter, perhaps.  A tie
fighter with laryngitis? He is bored. The mystery paperback he picked up at King’s Cross is not at
all “A gripping mystery perfect for fans of Agatha Christie” as it was advertised. A whodunnit,
where a) he has already guessed who dunnit, and b) does not care enough about any of the characters
to continue on. So he is left with watching the world speed by as he makes his way north. The train
is only partly full, and he’s happy not to share his four-seater cubicle with any other
travellers. He yawns. Another cup of tea would be welcome, and, as if by magic, the steward/car
attendant/server comes by with another thermos and asks, “More tea, sir?” “Don’t mind if I do”,
replies Tom, offering his china teacup for a refill. As he takes a sip of his hot freshly-brewed
tea, Tom is reminded of a train journey from his childhood.</p>

<p>He must have been eight, when his parents took him on a holiday to Scarborough. They had caught the
train from King’s Cross, but back then it had looked grimy and down-at-heel, and they had to push
their way through to the platform to board a train that had also seen better days. Tom had been
placed on seat opposite his parents with a white formica table between them. Dad had placed their
suitcases on the rack above them, and had settled down with the News of the World and a cigarette as
soon as the train left the station. There had been a buffet carriage on the train, but they had not
visited it, as mum had brought a flask of tea and cheese and pickle sandwiches to keep them
going. Tom had drunk his tepid tea from a plastic cup from their picnic set, wishing he could have a
coca-cola.  It wasn’t all bad, though: as a treat, mum had also brought a packet of Jaffa Cakes,
which Tom had gobbled up, biting off the chocolate first, followed by the orangey bit, and lastly
the sponge.</p>

<p>Tom was soon bored. He’d read through his Beano comic twice and was now peering out of
the window at the monotonous countryside, listening to the clickety-clack of the Intercity
train. His mum took out her interminable knitting; she was making him a new school jumper as he had
recently gone through a bit of a growth spurt. He’s endured many nights laying uncomfortably in bed,
unable to find just the right position to be sleep, like an old dog circling its bed before finally
settling down. At least he won’t need new school shorts, as he will - at long last - be able to wear
trousers to school as he enters Junior school. Tom had tried to get himself comfortable on the
train’s fuzzy turquoise seats, but without success. He slouched down in his seat and watched his mum
for a bit. Her hands moved quickly and skilfully, and the ‘V’ neck of the jumper, with its thin red
stripe was taking shape. Tom wished he had a book to read, but his mum had said that he wasn’t
allowed to bring his library books as he might lose them and then they would have to pay the
fines. Not that he has ever lost a library book, mind. When they finally arrived at York to catch
the connection to Scarborough, Tom had felt weary and restless, not at all in holiday mood, and had
grumpily trailed his parents across the bridge and onto the next platform, dragging his duffle bag
and wishing his parents owned a car like normal people.</p>

<p>Tom is woken from his reverie by a tannoy announcement: “We are now approaching York. When leaving
us here, please make sure you have all your belongings with you.” Tom takes his carry-on case from
the rack and puts his messenger bag over his shoulder. Taking a last mouthful of tea, he steps
towards the sliding doors, dropping the offending paperback into the recycling bin.</p>
