		  <h1>There Was A Man</h1>
		  <p>There was a man who was precise.<br>
He was ready with his tape measure<br>
to ensure things measured up.<br>
Too long, and he would be irritated.<br>
Too deep, and he would belittle.<br>
Too wide, and he would side-step.</p>
<p>He saw the world in opposites:<br>
this good, this not;<br>
this acceptable, that falling short.</p>
<p>He liked his breakfast a certain way: his tea an exact hue,<br>
his newspaper, a comforting echo of his own convictions.<br>
He liked his work a certain way: his train on time,<br>
his desk organised, his eight hours clocked.</p>
<p>There was a man devoured by guilt, survivor&rsquo;s guilt,<br>
brother, and mother and wife.<br>
He liked the art of conflict:<br>
to grind down the weary opposition<br>
with self congratulatory aggression;<br>
attrition sapping his opponents of their will.</p>
<p>There was a man who started well;<br>
he loved his country and adored his wife.<br>
But his children left him confused and baffled;<br>
Responding to his relentless standards<br>
with trepidation and despair,<br>
with hiding and avoidance.</p>
<p>There was a man who was loved.</p>
