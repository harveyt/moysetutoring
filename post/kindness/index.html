<p>We leave Greenock to catch the ferry to Dunoon; mercifully, the crossing is short and the waves not
too choppy, since, not only am I frequently car-sick, I am also prone to boat-sickness as well. This
time around the sun is doing its best to peek around the skitty cotton-wool clouds. With this fair
weather (by Scottish standards) we can make the journey above-deck, so that I can get some fresh air
and watch the seagulls bob and dip in the wake of the car ferry. We rarely stop for long in Dunoon,
but today there is a parade with a kilted pipe band marching down the high street. This splendid
tartan-clad troop is being followed by a rabble of enthusiastic locals, led by a middle-aged woman
wildly, happily, bashing a toy drum with a pair of washing-up mops that replicate the sheep wool
drum sticks of the bass drummers: unrestrained, unabashed bashing. The onlookers are all cheering
for her, the drum major completely unaware that he has a drumming interloper following him as he
swings and throws his mace. I watch with my mouth open, amazed that adults can be so uninhibited; my
mum enjoys the spectacle and laughs along with the rest of the crowd, but dad huffs and tuts and
says he finds it annoying. From Dunoon, we drive across the peninsular to the west coast and the
Kyles of Bute.</p>
<p>Once out of the little town, the road is mainly single track, through hills and valleys, sheep and
heather. The dog snoozes on mum&rsquo;s lap, only to be interrupted from her reveries whenever we drive
over a cattle grid. Each time her head pops up like a periscope, but seeing nothing of interest, she
returns to her snoozing. Along the side of the road there are black-and-white striped wooden posts.
I ask Dad what these are for, and he says that they are for marking out the road when there is snow.
I try to imagine this landscape covered in snow, but come up short: all I can see is heather with
the occasional stunted tree that has managed doggedly to survive in this bleak and windswept place.
Some of the fields are bounded by fences of barbed wire and strung with tufts of sheep wool, like
furry Christmas lights. I&rsquo;m trying to distract myself by looking for sheep or cattle or something to
count, but it is not working. The ripples of nausea are growing stronger like loathsome swash in my
belly; I know that soon I will have to ask to stop the car. Mum has already given me a plastic bag
and several Fox&rsquo;s glacier mints to suck on, convinced of their efficaciousness. I fear that the
sweets will soon be making a reappearance. I&rsquo;m not sure what to do: this is a difficult road for Dad
to stop on, and Mum, for whatever reason, is not in a good mood. Clearly the mop-waving
drummer-woman has not improved her humour. I wonder if I can hang on until we get to the cottage at
Kames. The familiar feeling of slow dread is grasping my chest with bile-slimy fingers, and I
inevitably start to retch, miserably, into the Mother&rsquo;s Pride bread bag. Dad stops the car at the
next passing point; Mum is already scolding me for not being able to keep my breakfast down, Dad is
telling me off for not asking sooner, my sisters are silent: a mixture of embarrassment and fear
since they have been in my shoes and are sorry for me, but not strong enough to defend me to our
parents. And then a miracle happens. An honest-to-goodness, genuine article miracle. As I&rsquo;m retching
and still being rebuked by Mum for waiting to the last moment, a car stops next to ours. The
occupant cannot understand why my mum is yelling at me as I&rsquo;m clearly in distress. They demand to
know what is happening. They tell my mum to go easy on me as I&rsquo;m only a child. And then they drive
off. I think Mum is too taken aback to answer; she shrugs it off and offers me more tissues. I am so
grateful to these strangers who have come to my rescue, who have taken my case and defended me
against my parents. This is a strange new understanding for me: other people might think my parents
can be unfair and unreasonable as well. I like this feeling. We arrive at the cottage with no
further incident, and unpack our belongings. My older sister and I take a walk down to the beach to
get some air. Nothing is said about the incident on the lay-by, but we are both thinking about what
it might mean.</p>
<p>The village chemist is double fronted with floor to ceiling windows, and a door with a bell that
jangles as you walk in. The paintwork is faded and peeling in places, and the windows are dotted
with faded-to-blue posters advertising various products: Johnson&rsquo;s baby powder and Colgate
toothpaste. The shop smells of Dettol and floor polish, a strange scent that pervades the bleached
wooden counters. and cracked lino on the floor. We come here for various items: washing-up liquid
and cough medicine, suntan lotion and plasters. The post-office is next door; it, too, has a jingly
bell that alerts the postmistress to the arrival of customers. Here we choose our postcards from the
range of somewhat elderly, sun-curved selection to send back home for Auntie G&mdash;, Grandma and Aunt
J&mdash;. Here we also buy our copy of the Sunday Post; our favourite sections are the cartoon strips:
&ldquo;Oor Wullie&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Broons.&rdquo; The local hotel stands opposite the parade of shops. It is a solid,
hearty building that has withstood many a winter and has many a tale to tell, should the fuzzy
flock-papered walls care to regale their stories of travellers who have spent an evening or two in
the saloon bar. The substantial granite fireplace in the lounge has a shield and crest above it: on
one side is a colourful golfing umbrella, and on the other a grinning midge wearing hob-nail boots.
Below the shield the motto reads: &ldquo;Raineo et Midgeo&rdquo;, which sums up this part of Scotland in a
nutshell. We come here for coca-cola as a treat whilst Mum and Dad chat with the locals in the bar.
The coca-cola is only a brief distraction, once we have sucked to the dregs through paper straws, we
have little to do except squabble between ourselves about whose turn it is to fill out today&rsquo;s
travel diary. There&rsquo;s not a lot to cover this week, since our time has mostly been spent pottering
around on the beach or paddling in the sea, or going for walks along the road from Kames to
Tignabruaich. The view down the loch is magical: every day brings a different combination of grey
and mauve and blue: seemingly benevolent mountains and water that matches the kindness of the people
who live here. Dad has been to the local golf course for a round or two using Uncle L&mdash;&rsquo;s ancient
golf clubs that are housed in an even more ancient golf bag. The course is up on some cliffs nearby,
exposed to rasping squalls that pick up the sand from the beach and deposit it in gritty showers.
The roughs are grazed by local sheep, and the fairways given a cursory clip now and again. There are
a few scattered trees bent double by the constant winds, digging their roots in like witchy nails,
determined to hang on. I wonder if the sheep are ever struck by golf balls, but they seem oblivious
to the peril they may be in. I also wonder how the golfers can see the next hole, given that Scot&rsquo;s
mists often drift along the coastline; I think they must hazard a guess at most of their shots. I
also think that many golf balls lie on the sea bed, poked at by curious sea life, and frowned on by
barnacle neighbours.</p>
<p>The days run into each other: walks and wanderings in quiet innocence through this place of homely
welcome and old-fashioned civility. We pack the up the car, wave good-bye to the cottage and make
our way back to Dunoon. On the way, we stop for some photos on the hills overlooking the loch. We
sit awkwardly with Mum, trying our best to look wise and thoughtful in our matching navy jumpers,
whilst being scratched and poked by the unyielding heather. My oldest sister sits with her knees at
her chest and her hand fiddling with a stray leaf, her hair clipped back and her brows drawn, she
looks unhappy and uncomfortable. My older sister has her chin clenched as she squints towards the
sunlight, her face showing resignation rather than the serenity she is hoping for. I sit at my
mum's feet staring straight ahead; my harshly cropped curls have no need for hair grips. I'm
thinking less about the lovely view and more about the rest of the car journey, grateful for the
break and breath of fresh air, hopeful that the rest of the trip back will pass without incident.
Dad is not satisfied with our pose, and tries another arrangement, this time with us holding bunches
of heather. The result is equally strained and self-conscious, but will still be included in the
slide show when we return home.</p>
