</p>
<p>Our classroom is outside the main school building. It is pre-fab, and probably not intended for
long-term use; it seems to have decided to put down roots and take up permanent residence. There are
two classrooms separated by a small hallway, where we can hang our coats. Our teacher, Mrs. P&mdash;,
is difficult to please. I do my best to keep her happy, but I come up short. I try hard with my
weekly news stories, but my spelling is not great, and my writing style is erratic. My mind wanders
off when I write, and my pencilmanship follows suit. Mrs. P&mdash; has pupils that she clearly likes,
and several that she really does not care for. I think I am in the latter group. Most of the time I
shrug off her sarky comments and snippy scolding. However, one
day<img src="media/image1.jpeg" style="width:3.07129in;height:4.47009in"
alt="fullsizeoutput_17a6.jpeg" />, I feel that she has been overly harsh with her marking.
She<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s given me a miserly six out of ten for a piece that I spent a lot of
time on, and I want to protest. She has written, <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>What has happened to your
writing?&quot; at the end of my work. After class, I get in the queue at her desk to register my
dissatisfaction with her assessment. I point to her comment and say, <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>Sorry,
Miss, I can<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>t read this.&quot; She huffs and tuts, and says her writing is
perfectly clear, and mutters, <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>Anyway, what has happened to your writing?&quot; I
shrug, and walk back to my desk, satisfied with my small win. It is around this time that we have a
fire along the back fence of next door<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s garden, adjacent to the alley way
and on the border of an old council dump. This provides me with another small win as I finally have
a picture pinned up on our classroom display: <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>There was a fire in
Susan<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s road&quot;, says the neatly-written caption. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>ve
attempted to portray the scene, but a fence on fire is not that dramatic, and there has been a
certain amount of artistic licence. The huge red and orange flames are a bit of an exaggeration, and
the startled looks on the faces of the firemen are probably misrepresented.</p>
<p>This summer, several girls in my class all have the same dress: gingham pattern, Peter Pan collar,
full skirt, it comes in different pastel shades. D&mdash; has yellow, L&mdash; has green, B&mdash; has blue,
and H&mdash; has pink. It can be purchased from a ladies<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span> magazine
<span dir="rtl">&ndash; &ldquo;</span>Woman&rdquo;, I think. I want to have one of these pretty dresses, and ask my
mum: <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>I don<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>t give a tuppenny damn what the other
girls in your class are wearing. Why buy something when you have something perfectly nice that is
homemade?&quot; So, I make do with my red-and-white striped shift dress with the appliquéd daisies around
the hem.</p>
<p>Assembly is our start to the day. Once we have hung our coats on our allotted pegs, we can file into
the classroom for Mrs. P&mdash; to take the register. We then all file out again across the playground,
into the main building and school hall for assembly. Mr. K&mdash; is our Headmaster; he is well-liked,
but I am a little scared of him. We have turquoise-coloured hymn books for assemblies, but
I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m always losing mine, and have to share. We sit, cross-legged, with our
teachers keeping a careful eye on us. Mrs. P&mdash; sings along heartily as Mrs. H&mdash; hammers away at
the piano. Mr. K&mdash; can play the piano, too, and I think he<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s much better
than Mrs. H&mdash;. I like the hymns. <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>He who would valiant be&quot; is one of the
best. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m not quite sure what it means to be a pilgrim, but I get the gist,
and think I might like to be a pilgrim when I grow up. Assemblies are always a bit of a struggle,
since, a) it is hard to sit still for twenty minutes, and b) Mrs. P&mdash; is on the look out for
fidgeting, so I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m frequently scolded for wriggling during Mr. K&mdash;&rsquo;s
announcements. We are often asked to pray for The Troubles in Northern Ireland to be over soon.
I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m not too sure what is happening, but it sounds very serious, and
I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m sad for the people who live there.</p>
<p>Every morning we have to work on maths and writing. Maths is hard for me: the numbers seem to jumble
together and make no sense. We are learning times tables, I can manage up to eight times, but nine
alludes me. I find writing tedious: making my loops and strokes just so seems a waste of my time and
I fidget my way through our lessons. Mrs. P&mdash; only has to look at me with her unique blend of
long-sufferance and condescension to get me to comply with her no-fidget rule. Every afternoon we
have some kind of creative activity: painting, singing, sewing. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m getting
the hang of cross-stitch, but I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m not a good singer. Painting seems to be
what I am best at, and for the May school fete, I want to enter one of my efforts into the art
competition. It is a circus scene that I have laboured over. The image I have in my head is
impossible to put on to paper, no matter how hard I try. I cannot get the perspective right, and the
elephant seems to be standing on the ringmaster<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s head, which cannot be
comfortable. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>ve been frustrated to tears and my mum has had to rescue the
painting from the bin. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m glad she does, as I win second prize. Although, I
think the judges have taken pity on me, or perhaps they are just dull-witted when it comes to
seven-year-old artwork. Clearly a painting with such an appalling lack of talent deserves to be put
in the dustbin, not on the wall.</p>
<p>Whilst my artistic talents are in question, my poetry appreciation is not. Mrs P&mdash; introduces us
to <span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>Old Possum<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s Book of Practical Cats&quot;.
I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m hypnotised and enthralled, and for once I don<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>t
fidget. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m drawn in by these stories and characters, masterfully depicted by
a master of language and rhyme. My favourite is
<span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>Growltiger<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s Last Stand&quot;: it<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>s
a bittersweet story of a pirate moggy who gets his comeuppance. He ends up having to walk the plank:
<span dir="rtl">&quot;</span>Ker-flip, ker-flop.&quot; I feel conflicted I like this idea of justice, but
I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m also sorry for Growltiger, who is probably not as bad as his made out and
is nice to his granny. I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m hoping that he can swim, and given that he is
pirate, I<span dir="rtl">&rsquo;</span>m assuming he can. I buy a copy of the book with my pocket money
and begin to memorise the poems.</p>

inspirational poem.</p>
